Unfortunately, this was not at all worth the 10 dollars (and 2 dollar shipping) that it costs.    On the actual player interface, every function is slow. select the next track, and you'll have to wait for up to 5 seconds for it to begin playing. And the transition from one track to another? rather than just playing the track, the player fades out of one and fades in to the next, a process which will shave the first few seconds off of every track. This is especially annoying if every track you have doesn't begin with a few seconds of unimportant ambient intro.     And Sound Quality! I have never before heard a player that so thoroughly neuters your audio! In the past, I had attributed audio quality and fullness to the original mp3 attributes, and the quality of the headphones used. For that reason, I encode all my music files at a minimum of 320, and use quite high quality headphones.     Alas, this player totally destroys the sound quality of your files. Either there is a low-end roll off that begins around 0hz, or the player just refuses to reproduce those tones. This is somewhat manageable when you plug the player in to another system that has its own eq, like a car stereo. At least then you can bump the low end up to make up for it. But if you just listen with headphones, audio will sound incredibly tinny, thin, and weak. Even going through the handfull of pre-set eq options, with the most 'bass heavy' selected, you will find incredibly weak sound.     Forget listening to modern electronic music, drum and bass, dubstep, footwork, or uk funky - the experience will leave you incredibly disappointed.    AVOID THIS MP3 PLAYER - spend twice as much, and get the similar looking, but far far superior coby flash player. With this player, you literally get what you pay for.\",\n",

Bought one B48 with GPS with filter and 64GB card for less than $200 a couple weeks ago to check it out, before buying a couple more for our local PD. Video and audio on this dash cam are excellent. Destroyed first camera due to lack of instructions (manual doesn't tell you that there is a locked and un-locked position for the suction cup, and shows in the illustration that the GPS is in an 90 degree angle which is the un-locked position). After it being dropped several times due to improper mounting, the G-sensor and video/audio quality suffered severely. I was really impressed with AMAZON; went to &#34;my orders&#34;, requested return of the item, was given a bar-code to print out, and the info that UPS was going to pick up the item at the next business day...Amazon paid for the return shipment, all I had to do is box it up and wait for UPS, who attached the label to the box.<br />Back to the dash-cam. When properly mounted, the GPS is perpendicular and on top of the camera (and the suction cop is awesome).<br />There are two micro USB ports; one on the camera, and one on the GPS. Consider the one on the camera as a data transfer to computer only (even though it can also be used for charging. The port on the GPS should be used for normal operation, as well as, setting the camera up.<br />Consider the &#34;up&#34; and &#34;down&#34; buttons on the left side of the camera as your &#34;scroll&#34; on your computer mouse (used for menu or mode).  Left top button is your &#34;Menu&#34; for set-up. Second button from the left is your &#34;ON/OFF&#34; button when you push and hold. It is also used to turn the lights in front of the camera &#34;ON&#34; when pushed momentarily.  The third button (right of the mounting bracket) is to select the &#34;Mode&#34; between video, pictures, and playback. The button on the top right is your &#34;Select&#34; button. This button is also used to restart your screen after it goes into sleep mode. The screen will go into sleep mode after a few minutes (depending on your set-up). When in sleep mode the Green light will stay on while the camera maintains recording. If the camera is charging, there will be a green light which will have a red light just below.<br />Do Not consider this device to be battery powered. As others have pointed out, the life span of the device without direct power supply is very limited (about 10-15 minutes).<br />Note 1: When mounting in a vehicle that is equipped with a USB port, keep in mind the capabilities of your vehicle. I have a 2011 F150 on which the USB turns off automatically after turning the vehicle off. The 12V power supply, on the other hand, will continuously charge the camera.<br />Note 2: I run windows 8.1, and have yet to install the driver (disc provided with the camera) for the device. The videos will run fine on any regular drivers.<br />Note 3: Don't down-load all the videos onto your computer. If your computer asks to transfer all files, cancel. Go to the drive instead, and only down load files that you need (downloaded 600 files, and it took me 1 1/2 hours). Once you have your camera set up properly, there will be a date + time stamp in the file name to make things very easy.<br />Note 4: I love the Auto &#34;ON/Off&#34; feature, but for LE purposes I would recommend leaving it on at all times (permanent power supply).<br />Note 5: Speed on videos is recorded in km/h. Well, just divide by 1.6, and you got mph.\",\n",

I can\\'t make comparisons with other models but this one seems to be PLENTY LOUD with different choices of the type of click you desire, and with the headphone jack output, you can listen to it through earbuds or feed it into a monitor system in a band setting. Many times our band tends to speed up the tempo, even if only slightly, during a song...this helps you lock in what the tempo should be when you are practicing.    The controls are pretty straight forward and easy to use except for the TEMPO CONTROL WHEEL.  Gee, the only reason I can think of for this engineering oversight is that it fits in a box better? It would work ok if the resistance on the wheel was less. But from the box, you pretty much have to use 2 hands to operate it. I modified it the first day I got it by using super glue gel and a small wire nut to make a tiny knob on the wheel. It works smoothly now because this gives you plenty of leverage to crank it with a finger.    The tap function is nice, just tap the beat as you listen to a song and it computes what the tempo is. It also has a light corresponding to the beat, red on the 1 beat, then green \\'til you get back to 1.  This unit may not be as portable as some but it will fit in my guitar case pocket. This is not a concern as I just got it to use at home. The unit can also emit reference pitch tones for tuning or ear training.

              " 'If you have the Sony Daily Edition PRS-950, this is the cover to get. The claims made by the manufacturer are all accurate -- pretty unusual in these days of endless hype.<br /><br />A couple of things I wondered about before ordering:<br /><br />1. If this cover offers so much protection, is it fat and bulky? The answer is no -- it\\'s very slim. The front and back of the cover are rigid but thin, and the edges extend out past the edge of the Reader just far enough to allow the zipper to close. The previous generation of this Reader shipped with an absolutely massive protective cover manufactured by Logitech, I believe. It made the PRS-900 almost as big as a netbook. The BookArmor cover is nothing like that; it\\'s quite small in comparison.<br /><br />2. Can the front cover be flipped all the way around the Reader to allow one to read without having to hold the two halves separately? The answer is yes: the cover\\'s \\\\\\\\\"hinge\\\\\\\\\" is fairly thin, and each half of the cover consists of only the flat surface, a slightly curved lip at the edge, and the sides of the attached zipper.<br /><br />3. Are the Reader\\'s controls really accessible without removing the cover? Yes: the Reader is attached to the cover using strips of \\\\\\\\\"click lock\\\\\\\\\" adhesive -- similar to velcro but stronger and more rigid, and lacking the annoying strands of thread that always appear in velcro when it\\'s been used for awhile. Two strips of this \\\\\\\\\"click lock\\\\\\\\\" are attached to the back of the Reader, then it\\'s pressed onto the back cover. Since there\\'s no elastic and only a small molded lip on the edges of the cover, all the edges of the Reader are easy to access.<br /><br />4. Is it heavy? Hmm, yeah, it\\'s a little heavy. The Sony Reader is so light that this does make a difference -- however even with the cover attached, the whole assembly only weights about as much as an average hardcover book. I don\\'t think it\\'s a problem, but for some people worried about arm fatigue after holding the Reader for an extended period, it\\'s worth taking into account.<br /><br />Another possible issue with the Book Armor is that the surface that touches the face of the Reader when the cover is closed is a thin panel of soft foam rubber. This is fine when the unit is closed, but when you lie the Reader on a table while reading, that foam surface seems likely to pick up whatever dust, crumbs, lint, etc., are on the table (or any other surface the foam comes into contact with), and then that dirt will be transferred to the Reader itself. That\\'s true of any cover that folds back under the Reader, but the foam seems like it will be harder to clean than other surfaces.<br /><br />The objections I have to this cover are minor, however. The combination of size and degree of protection make Book Armor the best cover I\\'ve seen for an ebook reader. And though it\\'s not cheap, it\\'s the same price as Sony\\'s flimsy standard cover that offers minimal protection. So I recommend the Book Armor very highly.<br /><br />One additional note: The \\\\\\\\\"click-lock\\\\\\\\\" adhesive requires considerable pressure to make the cover adhere to the Reader; I found it a little tricky to make it work. I was also a bit worried about applying so much pressure to the Reader. The instructions suggest turning the unit over and pushing from behind -- but the best way seems to be to close the two halves of the cover with the unit positioned as needed, then press them together until the unit locks in place. It might also be worthwhile attaching the two pieces of adhesive to the Reader as widely apart as possible (on the very top and bottom of the back of the Reader), so that you will be applying pressure to the frame of the Reader rather than the buttons or the screen.Another possible issue with the Book Armor is that the surface that touches the face of the Reader when the cover is closed is a thin panel of soft foam rubber.

              " 'I received my purchase which was sent via UPS, 2 day business shipping. The package arrived on time, in great shape and everything inside the same. I had fun installing the camera in my 2012 Tahoe. I mounted it on the windshield, directly in front of my rear-view mirror and ran the cable above the headliner, along the passenger side, down and inside the windshield side support covering,  under the dash and to the lighter adapter ( I plan on wiring it directly to the fuse box in the near future).<br /><br />Before ordering, I had several email conversations with the selling company and they were professional and replied within  just a short period of time. They stated that their testing showed the DR500 to run cooler than the DR400 and earlier models (more on that later). They also claimed to be an authorized seller for Pittasoft. I decided to give it a try and placed the order. After I received and set it up, I had a question regarding a setting, so I emailed the manufacturer Pittasoft. Before they would deal with me, they asked for my serial number to verify the product was sold by an authorized dealer. I emailed them the serial number which they indicated was an authorized unit and my questions were answered, however, due to and \\\\\\\\\"only due to\\\\\\\\\"  the difference in time between USA and Korea, several back and forth replies took a couple of days.<br /><br />I have had this in my vehicle for over 2 weeks (EDIT: July 5th, 2013, now nearly 5 months and still operating flawlessly it\\'s been in a lot of hot weather, even to the point that the camera was too hot to handle) and the unit runs perfectly. The unit records clear pictures, unfortunately, when I zoom in on a plate of a passing vehicle using the Windows software, most often the plate is unreadable due to  the picture\\'s pixels being scattered, and the unit is set at the highest setting, Full HD (1920x1080) @30fps, with no compression; thankfully this is not a deal breaker for me as the rest of the video and sound is exceptional. I did buy a larger 32GB mini SD card which works flawlessly.<br /><br />The unit has been running 24x7 and goes into the parking mode about 10 minutes after I park in my parking spot. The parking mode records things at by movement, usually locking in on the event 5 seconds before it sees it and then for one minute in length. I\\'m using the factory settings which seem sufficient for me. One night I had a 1 minute recording at about 2 am. I played the video only to see a small moth walking on the windshield in the vision path of the camera. I liked that, knowing that any passing movement in the middle of the night is recorded.<br /><br />I want my unit to be as stealth as possible, so in the event that someone were to break in to the vehicle, the recorder would not draw attention, I have all the LED lights settings marked \\\\\\\\\"off\\\\\\\\\" when the unit is operational which still leaves the WI-FI indicator on. I placed a piece of black tape over that LED and now it is totally dark. In addition,  I have the voice settings off so an intruder would not be alerted by voice either.<br /><br />I am currently in Florida and the weather is now in the 80\\'s. With the sun hitting the unit, it does get hot, but then so does everything the sun hits. I have not seen any issues on any of the video, still clear, smooth and good audio. Even out of the sun, the camera is warm to the touch, not hot, and the card, if I pull it out and immediately put it between my lips, it also is warm but does not feel dangerously hot. I\\'ll do an update on the units heat once summer is over or if I have problems sooner, but as of now, I\\'m very satisfied and don\\'t see a heat issue.<br /><br />So for now, the following on my likes/dislikes.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Cylinder shape -The unit is horizontal to the window making for a smaller look, so it\\'s not as obviously a recorder is in the vehicle.<br />*Wi-fi, via an Android App- (no screen-again keeping a small inconspicuous footprint) allowing to easily adjust height view, play back and verify everything is working properly. I can view it using my phone or my larger Android tablet, which really is nice. The application also has a settings page where all the camera settings can be adjusted (settings can also can be adjusted using the PC software; I don\\'t have a Mac so I can\\'t say one way or another for that). I have an old unused Droid I have set up with the Android App that is set using only the Wi-fi allowing me to keep it logged into the camera as long as I like.<br />*Available Settings; normal, event and parking.<br />  -Normal, allows for normal live recording while the vehicle is in motion.<br />  -Event, when an event occurs, such as a sharp corner, fast braking/acceleration, hard bump, an accident or damage to vehicle, the recorder will ensure that in the case of power loss, the one minute event is saved before the camera can shut down preventing the loss of the data.<br />  -Parked, the camera goes into what I visualize, a none record mode even though the camera sees everything going on in front of it and if and when any movement occurs, it begins recording 5 seconds before the movement and for at least 1 minute or until the movement stops.<br />*On all the time, so no lag for start up. When I get in the car, the camera has already recorded me approaching from the front and when I start the vehicle, the camera continues on recording.<br />*Internal clock, minutes are accurate but nonadjustable (this give credibility to the time of the recording), one only needs to adjust the time zone and the clock is right on.<br />*Long power cord, which should enough for most installations. In addition, unit comes with two 3M window stick-ons (more can be purchased) and 5 or 6 cord hooks that stick to the window or car molding to help direct the power cord.<br />*GPS system works well and is as accurate as any other GPS system I\\'ve used.<br />*No lag or missed time between video clips<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The factory SDcard had a Trojan Horse. My antivirus program (Norton) immediately found, quarantined and removed the \\\\\\\\\"autorun.inf\\\\\\\\\" file on the SD card due to it reporting the file infected with W32.Downadup/W32/Conficker. However, if one reads several forum posts about this, it seems this was common on these disks. I formatted the card with the format function built into the camera, all the operational files were automatically reinstalled but W32.Downadup was not. This must have been introduced only to the card when it was made, it is not in the camera software.<br />*The cost, however, now that it is installed and operational, I feel the cost was reasonable.<br />*The instruction booklet was translated to English, but it could have been done better, some sentences don\\'t make sense.<br />*Even though the instruction booklet is in English and touched on most of the options, it did not go into depth about the sensitivity settings, so in the event I need to change them, it will be a bit of trail and error. There is also a \\\\\\\\\"Brightness\\\\\\\\\" setting. I\\'ve played with it a little, but I\\'m not able to see a difference and again, the instructions failed to explain this.<br />*Most functions of the Android app  and Windows software is in English, however, there are a few spots where the English is poor or still in, I believe, Korean.<br />*The 140 degree view of the camera is nice, however in certain circumstances, mostly with rain or water, the playback view can look like a fish eye. If there were an option of an 120 degree lens, I believe I would opt for that.<br /><br />Bottom line, I think this is a great unit and I\\'m glad I opted to buy it. I plan on putting a second camera in my truck, to the rear, however I don\\'t think I will buy another DR500 for this since that unit won\\'t need all the options.',\n",

Alright, you're sitting there with a charging phone and a small pile of white plastic shavings on your desk.  All well and good.    If you're me, however, you only have about 4-6 weeks before the cord pulls out of the charging end.    What a piece.  Of.  Yonk.    By gosh, I demand a cheap, quality knockoff so I don't have to send Steve Jobs $40 for a stinking 35 cent USB cord!  Now appease me, shady Taiwanese plastics company!  NOW!\",\n",

It has the ability to upgrade via adding software apps for Android.<br />The biggest issue is the reflectivity of the image in the mirror, which is necessarily a partially mirrored surface. It comes with a protective film that although protects also dims the reflection even further, so I took that off and it helped. It is usable, but more reflectivity would have been nice.<br />I still think a protective film would be good for this, just a harder clearer one, as I am concerned the surface can get scratched too easily.<br />The camera hangs down, and to any alert eye is obvious, so there is little stealthiness available if you are trying to record on the sly. The camera does turn around 180, so you can record the interior of the car if that is what is currently interesting. There is a microphone that is inset on the unit facing forward to the window, so there is a bit of reduced audio detection because of that. If the radio is on I could not hear any conversations in the car.<br />There is a second camera that has no audio input, that can be positioned remotely, with a data/power line that is about 15ft long.<br />The battery in it last about 1 hour per charge; the unit can be powered by either a mini-USB connection or by a jack that serves as both the input from the second remote camera and a dedicated power connection, which apparently has to be downconverted to 5V, not the 12V that a car normally has.<br />The unit has wifi connectivity to any nearby wifi network, but not very sensitive antenna for that, you need to be near the wireless access point; there is a full android internet browser in the OS.<br />Although there is apparently a GPS antenna and circuitry in the unit, there is no installed navigation software, and you have to figure out how to download it and install it fromthe web. It needs to be an android based navigation software.<br />The dashcam software is fairly comprehensive, with options to record from one camera or both, to start automatically, or to start only when there is motion of the unit. There is also a subsection to review the recorded videos.<br />There is some voice feedback on the settings and actions, which is ostensibly in Engrish, but it is heavily accented in Mandarin and can be hard to understand. There is a small manual, also in Engrish and in Mandarin. It is marginally helpful as an operating manual.<br />The settings for recording allow for different selections of resolution, color/contrast/auto, file block size of the video recordings.<br />There are velcro straps that secure the unit to an existing rearview mirror; you have to take up the slack in those straps by positioning the starting point of the slack, a little tricky at first but soon becomes apparent what to do.<br />The unit can connect to a computer, but it is not obvious what one needs to do to actually mount the volume(s) to the computer, it is standard android OS interfacing. That would enable one to download the videos through the unit (as opposed to removing the memory card and doing it that way), or to load up the unit with software and media.<br />The TF SDCard it uses is the micro SD disk form which is very tricky to insert and even trickier to remove, which is inserted on the window facing side; removal cannot be done easily, on the fly or in an emergency, or even easily while the unit is mounted on the rearview mirror. If the card had a little string or handle attached it would easier.<br />I don't know if the unit has bluetooth capability.<br />Overall it is best used as a dashcam, and could be serviceable as a GPS navigation unit if you can get some good software installed. It has media playback capability if you can get some music or movies into it, but the screen is kind of small for that.<br />Keeping it powered is inelegant but necessary for continued use in the car, the USB jack sticks out sideways and that could cause stress damage on that port if powered as such - a 90degree adapter that points down might help with that. Alternately a 5-6volt power source (downconverted from the 12v car power) must be wired up to power it from another port.<br />Ask me any questions you may have and I will try to answer them.\",\n",

              " \"Two weeks ago I received my HM 901. It came with the standard amp. I ordered the balanced amp from Hifiman about a week ago. Since then I have been doing a comparison between the standard (stock) amp and the balanced amp.<br /><br />I have also been switching back and forth between the hi -res and the classic switch. The headphones I'm using are the Shure 1840, Grado 500, Sennheiser HD600 and my Sennheiser HD650.<br /><br />I owned and sold my HM801 so I know the difference in performance between the two. I also owned the HM601 but will not use this to compare either since it is not in the same league.<br />Simply put the HM901 is better then the HM801. I thought the HM801 would be hard to beat. I also thought the HM901 with the saber dacs might sound drier and not as analog as the HM801. It does not.<br />My  4 pin balanced 3.5 mini cable is from Charleston Cable company. Manufactured here in the good old USA. They are beautifully made, and the sound quality is exceptional. I can honestly say this having used various major brand cables on my HD600 and HD650. That said I highly recommend the Charleston/Audience cable. He is a great guy to deal with and very customer service oriented. Not to mention the quality of this cable. The cable he uses is designed and manufactured by Audience. This is simply my opinion. I have nothing to do with this company. Do a search for additional information.<br />My experience in music professionally has been a long one. I have been fortunate enough to have owned and tried many hi-end stereo products.So sound quality is very important to me.<br /><br />I won't go in to a long detailed description in terms of the sound quality the HM901 produces. There will be plenty of professional reviews coming out soon.<br />Having said that I will say Fang did one hell of a job designing this. Is the body brushed aluminum. No it is not. It's plastic. Does it feel like a $1000.00 portable player. In a way, yes it does. Does it look good to the eye.Well beauty is in the eye of the beholder. To me it looks fine. The plastic is a high grade plastic. The seams are perfect. Everything looks like they took their time to assemble it. Pride maybe. Whatever it is it just works. It feels right in the hand. It is easy and friendly to use. Again,to me I really like the way it looks.<br /><br />How does music sound on this amazing digital player. To my trained ears it sounds perfect. My  stereo home system is top of the line. I now spend 90% of my music listening with the HM901 and my Sennheiser HD650 instead. I do prefer the 24 bit music though. Just a bit more quality, detail, etc then 16 bit. Not a lot but enough. To me it's definitely noticeable. I am a person who is very very picky about the sound quality of the music I listen to. Sometimes maybe to picky. Especially how it's produced through the equipment playing it.<br /><br />I do highly recommend the balanced amp over the (mini amp) and definitely over the standard amp. There is a quite a noticeable difference between the standard and the balanced amp.<br /><br />I haven't had any trouble with  any particular manufactures memory cards although I prefer sandisc. The latest firmware works fine. Did not change the sound signature or cause any problems. Easy to install. Twice it skipped ahead on one of the songs I was listening to. That was before the firmware. It never happened again afterwards. I guess we will see what happens down the road.<br /><br />I Love everything about the HM901. To me it was worth every penny. To hear music produced with this high quality coming from such a small device is amazing. I am listening to sound quality that I enjoy more then my home stereo system lately. That's saying a lot. All this coming from a portable player. I could not ask for more. Fang did a super job in the design, build and quality of the HM901.\",\n",

              " \"I've had the BCT8 for just over a month now, so I think a fair amount of time has passed to comment. This scanner replaced a Bearcat 220XLT scanner that I had for over 15 years but got fried by a nearby lightning strike. I'm in the sticks, so I haven't had a need to use the available trunking features, as none of the agencies that I listen to use trunking, so I recommend you check out other reviews/comments if you want to know more about trunking.    Pros: Very good sound quality from the built in speaker. The built in stand allows you to set it up on a counter top or desk top and project the sound from the speaker. Buttons are easy to use, and the function for each is easy to understand.    Cons: Still using serial cables to program. This is outdated as just about everything today uses a USB cable. Software to FULLY program it costs $'s. The alternative is to manually enter each frequency into memory that you want to store to one of the memory channels.    Tip: Write/type out all the frequencies you want to program onto a spreadsheet. With one hand punching buttons on the scanner, and the other on the spreadsheet, loading frequencies into the memory bank can take less time. Prior knowledge of scanners and reading over the manual once or twice will help out too.    Overall it's well built. I'm contemplating installing a scanner in my vehicle for use while I'm on the road. If I do, it will be a BCT8.\",\n",

The straps that hold the nook in at the top cross over onto the volume buttons on the right, and onto the power button on the left. this makes it tricky to turn up the volume only a little bit b/c the added pressure turns it up much higher. If you have headphones on, then this is *wince with a side of ouch*. Most of all I worry about the power button, as there is pressure on that as well. I wonder if this will in some way affect the nook--maybe eventually leaving the power button decompressed permanently. That is, of course, pure speculation, and a little on the extreme side. However, I just got my nook three weeks ago and now the device will not charge.

Obviously, I gave them a HIGH rating, for standing behind their business.     Lets talk about the MP3 player.  On the good side, it arrived ahead of scheduled delivery in my requested color from a US Based seller of this product.  Using a free \\\\\\\\\"Flash Drive/Card Tester\\\\\\\\\" utility I downloaded at C-Net, I was able to verify it actually had a full 8 GB of storage in about 15 minutes.  So mine was not a 1 or 2 gb unit with a software hack.     Now lets discuss problems.  1. It would not hold a charge. Battery was solid Green, but it kept dying despite over 4 hours of charging.    2. The earphone port was smaller than the plug for the earphones enclosed with the unit.  Thinking maybe it had to \\\\\\\\\"snap\\\\\\\\\" in, I tried until I almost got it stuck.  The bottom white oval piece almost came out with the unit as I removed it. I tried other headsets/ units including those from my laptop and another MP3 player, none would fit.  So the port hole size was the issue.    3.The language setting said English. Using Windows Media Player, I easily loaded a playlist of jazz items from my laptop.  But when viewed on my laptop, all of my songs and folders were in Chinese Characters.  I had no idea what they were. (So forget trying to salvage an 8 GB \\\\\\\\\"flash storage drive\\\\\\\\\" out if this).    4. Unlike other electronics there are no codes on the back, i.e., model, proper disposal of battery, manufacturer, etc...    5. The clock and date settings would not save when the unit was turned off.  It kept reverting back to 2006.  So while the unit appeared brand new, I wonder if the software, firmware, etc.. is three years old.    6. The menu wheel was just added to look like an Apple Ipod.  It is just a white circular sticker with four active points.  I doubt if it would survive heavy usage.    7. There is a small quad fold quick start guide.  But the unit is NOT user friendly.  The Menu buttons do not follow a logical progression so navigation was insane.  Also the only way to get to the next song was to press the forward arrow.  I could not select an Album, then songs within it.  It appeared to be pre-set to play songs in order with repeat.  I could not get the repeat to turn off.    8. Once within a menu say radio, I could not Navigate back to the main menu without turning the unit off.  The center button worked, but I never knew when.

I paid 200 bucks plus 15 bucks insurance for this in case it ever blows.  I have a cheap Boss amp pushing it the amp came in a kit that claimed it was 2000 watts.  I know its not really 200 wats but it is ok for a starter amp.  First thing I noticed when I took it out of the box was how huge and heavy the magnet structure is.  My box is secured to the trunk so I had to install this with gravity as my enemy.  I just got back from a test drive with it.  I played this record by a band called 'Ahab', the record was 'The Call Of The Wretched Sea'.  Its got lots of heavy low and slow bass with really fast bass drums.  My old sub just couldnt deal with it.  I turned my stereo up as loud as I could stand and turned the amp all the way up and this sub had no problem handling it.  Alot lower bass with it.  I can tell that if I want to get the full potential out of this sub, I' going to have to get a better amp.  I'm happy with what Ive got now though.  At least I know that I probly wont be able to blow it.  Bottom line, buy this.  Its worth it.<br /><br />Update:  Ok, so Ive had this for a few weeks, I got a Kenwood 1,800 watt sub amp for it.  At first I tried it at max gain and half bass boost on the amp and flat on the bass for my head unit.  I just have 6inch 180 watt door and rear speakers, they cant handle much bass.  After I determined that the sub could handle that level while cranked, I went ahead and turned the bass boost all the way up too.  I mostly listen to hard rock and heavy metal.  I rarely listen to rap music.  For the type of music I listen to this sub is perfect.  Like I said I have my amp turned all the way up and this sub sounds perfect when I have the volume cranked as loud as I can stand with no distortion.  Can sometimes feel my hair move when its really loud also.  Good sub, get it.\",\n",

I did not find a second or two lag time to be a problem.<br /><br />Now... as a navigation unit... that\\'s another story. I have used a number of automotive GPSs and marine GPS chartplotters with SONAR. The user interface on the 5255 was fine - I actually like the address lookup and prompting compared to Garmin\\'s approach. That\\'s about all I can say positive about the GPS functions. The unit is extremely slow to boot up and never took less than three minutes to acquire satellites - often it was ten to fifteen minutes and on more than one occasion the unit never did acquire satellites. (This was mounted on the dashboard under the rather large windshield of the Tahoe with no tall buildings or obscuring trees around.)<br /><br />One of the few times it did find satellites, the GPS wanted to take us about ten miles out of the way to get home from our local Wal-Mart. In addition, the unit would accept my street address (in a well-established neighborhood), but there was apparently no street in front of my house. Leaving the house, the instructions would begin with, \\\\\\\\\"Proceed to [my street name] and continue to [the next corner].\\\\\\\\\" The \\\\\\\\\"dashboard\\\\\\\\\" instructions were confusing. For example, if there was a turn in our route five miles ahead, the indicator would show a straight-ahead arrow and 3 miles rather than the turn arrow and five miles. I returned the unit and purchased a Garmin of the same size with the same feature set (minus the backup camera). The Garmin boots in only a few seconds, acquires satellites almost instantly, and makes sense with routing and turn instructions, etc. In fact, the Garmin acquired satellites with four bars\\' strength sitting in my living room!

Because of that this isn\\'t easy to figure out, and the instructions posted here are messy looking, I can\\'t even remember how I figured this thing out, it wasn\\'t from looking at the instructions here that\\'s for sure.<br />2) The time function is messed up because the seconds are too slow, so it literally within one second will start going off the correct time. It\\'s also in military time only.<br />3) It\\'s so confusing trying to figure out how to get out of radio mode that I just turn the thing off and then back on.<br />4) No AM reception. Why don\\'t any mp3 players have AM! Maybe one does, the very expensive CC Radio and knock offs, that\\'s it.<br />5) Figuring out where the battery compartment was, was confusing too, including the USB port, since the thing looks seamless! It\\'s like alien technology hah. Sadly it probably isn\\'t waterproof, but at least the seams are very flush, should help keep out dust.<br />6) It cycles colors before you change a color, so that when you start it up for the first time and start selecting things it is as if it\\'s going crazy.<br />7) The contrast sucks.<br />8) Putting it on hold prevents it from being written on, as in you can\\'t add anything to it when you have it connected to your computer. And the screen says \\\\\\\\\"zzzzzzz\\\\\\\\\" as if it\\'s \\\\\\\\\"sleeping\\\\\\\\\" rather than telling you it\\'s connected.<br />9) It\\'s a very irritating feeling, at least if you have hard hands like me, to press the mode button down to select items, because it feels sort of like you are being prodded, like someone is poking you, it just doesn\\'t feel good, make me feel like puking which ruins the enjoyment of trying to listen to the music for the first few mins, at least for me. I\\'d rather press down on flat button. If there was a separate selection button it would probably allow the two buttons separately to last longer. And I\\'d prefer pressing down on arubber covered button, not the tiny plastic feel of the mode button.<br />10) There\\'s a thin opening where the USB dongle is, so that dust can easily get onto the LCD. I know because I put it in my pocket and took it out a few minutes ago, about (1:50 AM, 10-26-2012)and noticed a black speck under the plastic screen, and it took a very stong blow of breath to get rid of it. Now that I think about it I may seal it with super glue.<br />11) Doesn\\'t handle low variable bitrates, below 128 well apparently, as one custom album I made using that had a scratchy sound at the end of every track just about, it wasn\\'t super horrible but it was irritating.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) Comes with a protective lcd cover, will prob wear off fast but it\\'s better than nothing.<br />2) Lightweight<br />3) Not shiny even though the picture may show it is shiny, instead it\\'s a plastic-like case, so it shouldn\\'t be a big prob with finger oil making it look nasty.<br />4) DOES NOT HAVE A NASTY MADE-IN-CHINA TOXIC PLASTIC SMELL! THANK GOD. I hate that WD-40 SMELL!!!!!!!!<br />5) FM radio works fine.<br />6) Music/audio files sound fine.<br />7) 8 gigs is a huge amount of space for a cheap mp3 player.<br />8) It lasts a long time on an AAA battery, a quality one. I\\'ve been listening to it from 3 AM to 1:38 PM, even as I\\'m typing this.<br />9) Selecting a folder of music on this is amazingly simple I found, I thought I\\'d have to just scroll through every single track, but just hold down the play button during a song and then press the mode button, and then you can start scrolling through the folders.<br /><br />If there was a waterproof version of these with an OLED screen and the mode button was rubber coated, and maybe even a few solar cells on the back like calculators always have so that it can charge while dangling around on you in the sun, then I\\'d buy tons of these if I could.<br /><br />I haven\\'t tried out the microphone yet but no doubt for $13 it sucks, bit it\\'s better than nothing tho as an emergency back up.<br /><br />11/8/2012 4:51 AM: The mp3 player broke about an hour ago, everything works except the play pause button.

This makes the keypad useless, since it doesn\\'t run on batteries.     I might buy another one at this price, but I\\'d be very protective of that connector. It would be great if it were a little sturdier.  ----------    This Ionic keyboard was the best bang for the buck, and I\\'m *very* glad I chose it.    I primarily use my Nook for internet connectivity and email, and a touch screen keyboard doesn\\'t work well for typing quickly with manicured fingernails. I researched all of the Bluetooth-compatible keyboards available (I came up with sixteen) and made a table to compare features, prices and customer reviews. i read *all* of the reviews. (Yes, I\\'m compulsive) I narrowed the selection down to three, and chose this one because it seemed the most reliable for my Nook HD-7 (verify the model when reading reviews), most competitively priced when considering reliability, and compact enough to slide into my purse.    The keyboard arrived more quickly than predicted, connected to the Nook almost automatically (follow the three or four steps for first-time access on the included direction sheet), and stays reliably connected from session to session. The keyboard comes with a (sturdy plastic I\\'m pretty sure - not leather) case to protect it and the Nook. The case also acts like a Nook stand, so the whole thing is only a little thicker than the Nook, itself.    For the past month, I\\'ve used this daily for a couple of hours at a time, and I\\'ve had no problems. I\\'d ***definitely*** chose it again if I had a do-over. It lets me use my Nook like a very portable laptop or inexpensive iPad for googling and emailing, and those are my primary requirements,    All of the keys function properly and reliable. A reviewer in November 2013 listed all of the functioning PC-standard key combinations, and that was a hugeselling point for me, but I haven\\'t tried them yet because I\\'ve yet to figure out how to highlight and select text to perform operations on it.    The only negatives have nothing to do with functionality:    Due to the space limitations that make the Ionic keyboard compact, two keys that I frequently use (quotation marks \\' and \\\\\\\\\") are accessed with the function key, so I have to stop and think for a second while I\\'m typing.    The fully charged keyboard outlasts the fully charged Nook by far, but I have to remember to toggle it Off when I\\'m done. (I stuck a little paper tab next to the switch so it overhangs the cover when it\\'s closed. If I haven\\'t folded in the tab when I\\'m done with my Nook, it sticks out and reminds me to go back and flip the switch.) The November reviewer said that it has a hibernation/sleep mode, but I\\'m not so sure about that.    The included charger connects to a USB port, but the keyboard is also compatible with my phone charger. If I\\'m going to be away from home for a while, I bring the Nook charger and my phone charger and plug both in while working, just to be safe. You can also buy a USB-to-AC converter plug for a few bucks at the hardware store, if you want one.    Once, I may not have closed the case tightly enough and the keyboard magnets didn\\'t hold it, so it slipped out. Luckily that happened at home, so I didn\\'t lose the keyboard, and I pay closer attention now when I put the Nook into my purse.    The Nook itself doesn\\'t always shut off when I close the case, so I shut it down manually when I\\'m done.    Because this keyboard is the same size as the Nook, typing is a little cramped. For that reason, I almost went for a Zagg keyboard because it\\'s wider so it\\'s more convenient for typing, and also highly-rated. The Zagg keyboard comes with a cover that also serves as a Nook stand, but the wider size means it isn\\'t as compact and the cover is only for the keyboard (so I\\'d need another one for the Nook), so I\\'d have two items to cope with on the run. If dragging the setup around were no problem, I might have gone for Zagg, because it also may be sturdier.    But the Zagg keyboards are also two or three times the price of the Ionic keyboard.    For less than $30 including shipping, the Ionic keyboard is a great purchase. It\\'s perfect for someone like me, and I recommend it without reservation.',\n",

              " 'Ok so when I saw the Mdr 7509 had been redesigned I got all antsy about what I was missing. So when recently buying more cans for studio and CHiPOD use I looked into a few pairs of MDR-7505 phones. The salesman also had some very well priced new MDR-7509HD sets which I picked up on a pure whim.     So I get home and break out the 7505 sets to compare and start with the let down...No such let down came. The 7505 sets although smaller perform extremely well when compared to the old 7509 series.     Then came head to head tests between HD and Previous series 7509\\'s. I must say the low end on the HD set is compromised to clarify their \\\\\\\\\"better Midrange response\\\\\\\\\". I found them more annoying for long sessions of monitoring...I prefer less high end in my sound and a more subdued midrange. Thats just my own preference.The old 7509 series is bassier if that\\'s what tickles your fancy. It certainly does it for me. So I personally prefer the old series and the 7505 set to the HD series. Sorry to disappoint.     This now bring the question...Which of the 7509\\'s are more colored and which are flat? So much for industry standards.     If you are getting them because of the 80 KHz response you won\\'t hear it unless you\\'re a dog eared human being.Typical hearing in a Human is commonly between 15Hz and 20 KHz.     This being said they are great phones but if you get a chance compare both sets before buying and see which you like best. For me they are no loss as I can use them for monitoring and recording with other musicians in studio.Happy shopping and always trust your own ears not someone\\'s reviews. we all hear differently.',\n",

It's especially terrific on long airplane flights -- just pull the tray down, adjust it, then set up the Kindle's stand, have your drink ready, and it helps make the general unpleasantness of flying these days, a little more bearable.    I looked at dozens and dozens of covers, but only the Duragadet and one other offered a way to prop up the Kindle, and this is far more sturdy than the other one. The black leather looks smart, is thick enough to protect it, and the front flap cleverly flips around to be part of the stand. There are at least ten or more notches on the stand portion, to allow you to adjust the Kindle to different reading angles.    A small nitpick is that some of the stitching isn't perfect, and a little off center in places, but that's a very minor imperfection. The Kindle slides in snugly and the opening at the bottom is large enough and placed correctly to allow you to flick the Kindle on and off. For about $23 and change, this is an excellent cover, in my opinion. Several other Kindle users have asked me about it, and have tried putting it on their own. Everyone thinks it's an ingenious design, and I think at least two of them have purchased it to replace their old covers.\",\n",

To say that it was easy and hassle free would be an understatement. In fact, the time it took from initially filing my claim for a damaged cell phone online to having the full retail value of my phone Paypal'ed to me was just over 24 hours. That's right, just barely more than one day. The process was incredibly simple - all they needed was an invoice from a local cell phone repair shop of my choosing with either the repair cost or a statement that the phone wasn't repairable. Mine wasn't, I got a note to that effect on the store's letterhead, Squaretrade sent me a shipping label, and I had the money in my Paypal account within 2 hours of when I dropped the package off with UPS. They didn't even wait to receive the phone back before transferring the funds. That's customer service - no week of waiting for shipping, no long delays while it sat in their repair depot waiting to be evaluated, just a fast, smooth transaction. I can't recommend them highly enough, just be sure you read the warranty terms so you know what you're getting and what you're not.\",\n",

The bracket that you place on the GPS device to attach the suction cup is on my device.  Because this bracket sticks out a bit, I need to place the screen facing down, facing the exterior of the case. There is an interior mesh pocket that holds the cords for your device.  You have to place the cord in just right so the bulky part of the car charger is on the side of the GPS screen.  Otherwise, it would be hard to zip shut.  But that also makes the case slim enough so it's not too bulky. The other cord that you use for computer downloads also fits in the mesh pocket.  Obviously the suction cup will not fit in the case, but you could always leave that in your car or pack that someplace else when using a rental. I don't even need to use the suction cup when driving my car.  And the case is somewhat hard which will offer some protection to the GPS screen. I love the purple color as well.

I liked that the cover could be snapped down so it doesn't come open when it's in my bag and that it could be flipped over backwards and snapped to hold the iPod like an easel for watching videos.  The cover works well in that it has not spontaneously opened in my bag even once but I'm not sure how well the easel feature would work for watching movies on any kind of public transportation.  It does hold the iPod upright but it's not terribly sturdy and I imagine it would fall over if there were any turbulence, bumps, etc.  <br /> <br />The screen looks pretty good but it did take me about half a day to figure out that there is a protective plastic adhesive covering on BOTH the outside AND the inside of the screen.  The inside covering is also a bit difficult to remove since the leather is stiff and there isn't much room to get your fingers in there.  I agree with previous reviewers about how easily the screen cover scratches.  A fingernail will easily gouge a large scratch in it so I have to be careful when cleaning it.  However, since the screen cover is protected by the leather flap most of the time, mine hasn't gotten scratched much at all in the 2 months I've had it.   <br /> <br />The only truly disappointing thing about this case was the color.  I got it in green and it turned out to be a darker shade than I expected from the photos. I thought it would be a kind of day-glo green and it turned out to be more of an old lady chartreuse.

When I first plugged my Ipod into the wall charger, I got an error message saying that this was not a compatible accessory.  I powered the Ipod off and on again and the charger worked fine.  The only complaint I had with this purchase was the condition of screen protector upon receipt.  All of the items come in the same package, a padded plastic envelope and the screen protector had some deep scratches on it, probably from shipping/handling.

Three films are included, giving you the opportunity to make a mistake    One suggestion for applying these screen protectors - keep a can of compressed gas air duster nearby.  Clear the surface of the phone with a quick blast of air immediately before applying the film so ensure no dust or lint is on the surface.  If after exposing the adhesive side of the film you notice a speck of dust, a quick blast of compressed air will generally remove it, and you won't need to touch the film.\",\n",

Kinda a bummer because I wanted to fit more movies.  Low and behold I plugged in a 16gb flash drive and it worked flawlessly!  Awesome, that means I could fit close to thirty movies at 600mb a piece.  For the price and functionality this system is great.

I saw a couple of reviews of the X1 on YouTube and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Let me first say that the sound quality is AMAZING!!  The headphone jack also serves as a line-level output if you need to feed it into an amplifier.  Just don't connect headphones while it's set up for line-level or you'll destroy your ears.  In headphone mode, this little player still puts out a lot of volume.  Upgrading the firmware was pretty simple, and the interface is nice once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />The X1 comes with a micro USB cable and a black rubber shell which covers the micro SD slot but doesn’t block the USB port.<br /><br />It will supposedly work with in-line headphone controls.  I don't have headphones with in-line controls, so I couldn't test it.<br /><br />The bad'ish:<br /><br />The instructions which come with it are pretty useless.  You'll probably need to do a few searches in order to figure out a few things.<br /><br />You can make playlists on the player itself, but the process of importing playlists took a bit of trial and error.<br /><br />The scroll wheel needs to be faster.  Scrolling through a large catalog of artists takes longer than is should.  You can, however, scroll backwards alphabetically, which is nice.<br /><br />At this time, I'm using a 128gb micro SD and the &#34;update library&#34; function stops at 5800 files.  This means the listings in the &#34;Category&#34; section will be incomplete (Artist, Album, Song, etc...).  However, if your library is alphabetized by artist on the memory card, then you can access all of your music using the player's file browser instead of going through the Category menu.  I actually prefer going through the file browser anyway and missed having that option with my iPod and other players.<br /><br />Is this player for everybody?  Probably not, at least not yet.  I'm sure a few more firmware updates will make this player more user friendly.  If you like the ability to click and drag your music onto the device and organize it however you see fit, and don't mind rolling up your sleeves to figure out a few things, then absolutely.<br /><br />Even with the several quirky things about this player, I give it 5 stars.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I just received an email from Fiio stating that the player is currently limited to 5800 files in the &#34;category&#34; section and that they are fixing it in a firmware update.

And the internet radio is better than advertised, as you can browse through all the internet radios available with your computer turned off, and not only listen to the 18 presets of your choice.  I was a little bit worried about streaming music from my notebook, as in the user guide is not very well explained how to set the Windows Media Connect. I looked for this software in Windows Vista and in Windows Media Player, but I couldn\\'t find how to open it. However, I noticed that the \\\\\\\\\"Soundbrige\\\\\\\\\" was already detected by my notebook. Therefore, I just agreed to share my library and I was then able to browse my entire music collection through my ROKU.  Now me and my wife are addicted to internet radio. I arrive home and go straight to my bedroom to turn on my music system. We listen to different radio stations through a good AV Receiver, which improves the sound quality. Of course the sound quality is not CD\\'s, but you can find some high Kbps\\' radios out there. The only low is that sometimes some radios loose the connection, so they have to buffer again, which takes about 3-10 seconds. This varies depending on the day and time of the day. Anyhow, sometimes you can listen through many hours without a single interruption.  The sound quality when you stream from the hard drive is excellent, although I keep on listening to different internet radios by now.  I am using a digital coaxial cable, which noticable improved the sound qualitycompared with the supplied analogue stereo RCA cable.  The bright display is clear enough, and you con dim the display at night. I am only missing a sleep function...  The remote control is nothing fancy, but with is ergonometrically correct and with the necessary functions. However, I usually use a Logitech Harmony remote control, so I can control my AV Receiver and the ROKU Soundbridge in a very convenient way. I can even have now some direct access to my presets (something that the new ROKU remote control does, but with only 6 direct presets).  In a couple of years time (or maybe less), almost all of the AV Receivers and Hi-Fi systems will come with ROKU\\'s features, but if you need them now (and you should), this is the best (and less intrusive) device out there. Maybe a wi-fi \\\\\\\\\"n\\\\\\\\\" is in the pipline... which would be nice.  In conclusion, this is the best gadget I have bought lately. I am more than happy with my decision.',\n",

              " \"I have a 7th gen 160GB Classic iPod and wanted to take advantage of its large capacity by recording family events and stories and the little kids' priceless comments.  Basically the unit works well, but isn't perfect. After some experimentation, here are my findings:<br /><br />The little mic is easy to use once you get the hang of it.  When it's attached to the iPod, it takes a minute but then a new category appears in your main menu--Voice Memos.  Although there is an 'instant recording' button on the device, I didn't get that to work, however by selecting Voice Memos from the menu with the click wheel, you'll get the Recording screen where you can 'Start Recording' using the click wheel.  You pause the recording with the click wheel too, then resume the recording or save it via menu options.  You can play back any of the recordings you've saved, each of which is labeled with time and date.  You can delete any you don't want to keep.  When you sync to iTunes saved recordings are automatically uploaded to a newly created playlist on your computer called Voice Memos.<br /><br />When I first started recording things, I wasn't alert to the red 'record' dot that shows on the iPod screen.  Anything I recorded before the dot showed up wasn't picked up.  I also found the quality of my recordings was far better and had much better volume when the 'Gain' switch was in the off position, contrary to the directions.  Overall, I didn't find the directions all that great, but with some experimentation I was able to do everything I wanted to.  I tested recording quality both hand held and up to about 6' away and was very satisfied with the results.<br /><br />Bottom line, the unit doesn't feel top quality, but seems to do a good job of recording. The drawstring carrying bag that comes with it is big enough to carry my iPod Classic as well as this small mic attachment.\",\n",

These transmitters will never be CD quality, but they are a good way to play large numbers of mp3 files from a USB or SD memory card on a car stereo that only has a CD player and no other inputs.  The only problem we have ever had is if the car antenna is too far from this transmitter, you may suffer either no sound, or poor quality.  Also on occasion as we travel a station may bleed into the frequency at which we have set it, but that has been rare and we just tune to a different frequency and it is fine.

Where it used to be green, now it's just white like paper. (UPDATE: Yes, it is just paper. Sort of a thin cardboard.)<br /><br />In addition, there is no ring on it anywhere for a lanyard, if that matters to you. It doesn't matter overly to me, but I would have preferred it. In any case, I'm just letting you know.<br /><br />Lastly, it is SKINtight. You cannot fit an iPod (3rd gen) in here if it has even those thin, hard protective snap-on cases on them. My old case that is very similar to this one fit my iPod with the snap on case perfectly. With this one, there is just no way. So it's an either/or thing.

The volume in the TV never did work very well, but I tolerated it.  Tried doing updates and troubleshooting, but nothing helped.  Finally, I called Square Trade to see about my warranty.  The first call really didn't do any good because they put me in contact with a technician that &#34;decided&#34; he had fixed the TV, when he hadn't.  They closed the claim because he wouldn't listen to me.  So...  I called back, explained to the second person my experience with the first, and them immediately contacted a repair service to come fix my TV.  The repairman knew exactly what was wrong, so contacted Toshiba to get the part needed.  The part isn't made anymore, so I was out of luck.  I called Square Trade back and told them it couldn't be fixed.  They advised me that they would contact the repairman for verification and call me back.  Within a couple of hours they called me back and advised me they were mailing me a check for the full purchase price.  I received the check within about a week!!!!!

              " 'This is my first ever review, so please bear with me.  I ordered this product for a 2001 Ford Taurus.  It was a Christmas gift for my son.  The next afternoon we pulled the factory radio out and realized the cables would not match up.  After closer inspection of the USA SPEC PA11 directions, there is a small notation, for Taurus\\' and Sables an extra cable is required.  On those cars the tuner is in the trunk and just the control head is in the dash.  Well, we put the factory radio back in the dash and grumbled a little.  Nowhere in the Amazon description is any mention of needing an extra cable for a Taurus.  After more research on the internet we decided by the time we ordered the cable, it would be easier just to buy an aftermarket radio and a Metra in dash adapter (which came with the elusive cable).  Best Buy had the Metra kit and radio in stock.  This did turn out to be the best plan, as the aftermarket radio is better than the factory one anyway. I contacted Audiosource and they were very helpful with the return and understood my frustration.  Clearly with Taurus and Sables being big selling cars this must have happened to someone else before. So, the moral of the story is, if you want to install this kit, or any aftermarket radio in a 2000-2007 Taurus or Sable, you will need an extension cable that goes from the in-dash unit all the way to the trunk!  This cable is not even available from Amazon unless you purchase a Metra dash kit.  Then it is included with the kit.  A small notation in the application description would have saved me a lot of time and shipping costs (both ways).  In the Product Description, they notate that the factory radio must have a CD button.  One more notation stating that Taurus\\' and Sables need an extra cable would have saved me time and frustration.  I have since put another radio in my own Taurus using a Metra kit and an aftermarket radio from Amazon.  It is like \\\\\\\\\"Knuckle Bruiser\\\\\\\\\" says; unless you are pretty handy, it might make sense to have it professionally installed.  Hope this helps someone out there.  Good Luck!',\n",

I buy 3 or 4 a year, I seldom pay big money for them, and I just see how they work and which ones are worth even the $20-$30 I spend on them.<br /><br />Well, of all the dozen+ I have ever bought - this one is the best. I use my various MP3 players to listen to audio books, if I am traveling (out of a car - by plane or motorcycle) I set myself up with an audio book or 2 and I am out the door.<br /><br />The things I like best about this unit are:<br /><br />1 - It uses 1 AAA battery. This makes it easy to replace when it dies, and I get pretty good (12 hours+ on average) life out of a AAA in this guy. I prefer units that take a battery over those with a built in rechargeable battery, as in my experience, they tend to lose charge time over the life of the unit. All of the rechargeable built in batteries I have had in an MP3 player end up lasting under an hour within 6-8 months. For my purposes, that is worse than useless. There is nowhere to plug in an MP3 player if you are on a motorcycle, going down the highway...<br />However, every gas station in America has AAA batteries for sale - or close to it anyways...<br /><br />2. - There is built in memory you can use if you like AND it has an SD memory slot. I LOVE the SD memory slot. I can throw a book on each of a few different cards, and there is no hunting for the start of the right one. Finish a book, pop in the next SD card. That makes the versatility in this guy limitless.<br /><br />3. - 1/8\\\\\\\\\" stereo headphone jack lets you plug in almost any set of headphones you like - I can\\'t stand them new mini jobs that are the same size as cell phone accessories, (2.5mm?) as there just aren\\'t many QUALITY set available at a reasonable price.<br /><br />4. - It may sound silly or MINOR, but this unit has a built in place to attach an anchor. I use a leather thong that makes it akin to a pendant / necklace, but you could use about anything you wanted to in there - Where ever I am, and whatever I am doing, I don\\'t need to be holding my MP3 player in my hand while I am at it. I slip the thing over my head and it hangs down around chest high, so if I need to pause or crank it up or down it is right there.<br /><br />5. - Price... For what I have put into one of these, if I lose it / break it / feel like giving it away to someone - it isn\\'t a big deal. I can\\'t see spending HUNDREDS of dollars on something with a few more features I don\\'t care about, and then when it breaks, or I lose it - I am ticked.<br /><br />All in all, this is without question, one of the best MP3 player money can buy - IMHOo in there - Where ever I am, and whatever I am doing, I don\\'t need to be holding my MP3 player in my hand while I am at it.

Sometimes, water gets trapped between the iPod and the plastic casing (kids!)and I have yet to be successful with removing that plastic cover. Also, I can't use the Non-Apple adapter/charger I normally use because the plug is too big and won't fit the device if the cover is on. This is not a problem with Otterbox.

The holster has a very heavy metal D button that slides upside down into a bracket slot on either belt clip. When the holster is rotated upright, the D is securely locked in the slot.<br /><br />The steel clip has a really good grip. Thus I chose to use it rather than the fabric clip with the snaps. Unfortunately one day I had it clipped over my belt plus the waistband of my blue jeans (where I normally wore it). I sat down in the car just right to lift the clip and holster up off my belt and drop it on the ground as I got out of the car. The iPod was not damaged at all by the drop. The holster is much too rugged for that. I didn't notice the loss. Later a very kind cyclist called me to tell me that she had found my iPod. In the meantime something heavy had rolled over the pouch with my iPod inside. The iPod got very slightly bent but works fine.  The bracket with the D button got bent so that the D can now turn with respect to the holster, and the D no longer locks into the slot. I do not blame the holster or its hardware. It is really tough. After the accident and before the D got too loose I switched to the fabric belt clip. I had no trouble with it until the D button worked loose and I quit using the holster.<br /><br />I have just ordered a new Camo NZTK holster, i.e. the same model. I have confidence it will be fine. Although I originally thought the steel clip was better I will probably stick with the fabric one on the next holster.\",\n",

Now I can just plug in the ctek and top off the charge any time.  Admittedly if everything were functioning perfectly or you never had to store your car for a long period, this would not be needed, but we do not yet live in a perfect world, thus it makes life a tad bit easier.<br /><br />Having used this with the ctek's optima battery setting (I also changed to an optima battery [[ASIN:B000AMDDBQ Optima Batteries 8012-021 D34 YellowTop Dual Purpose Battery]] so that I had some deep cycle capability on my honda) it has had a second value.<br /><br />I installed an escort 9500ix radar detector at the same time [[ASIN:B001F0RPGG Escort Passport 9500ix Radar/Laser Detector (Black)]].

It\\'s more like a Kindle or Nook on steroids.<br /><br />I got this yesterday, so I\\'m still exploring some things.<br /><br />STRENGTHS: great price, small compact size, can read pdfs, great downloaded video playback, GetJar compatible, included ereader app smooth, included task killer/manager, wi-fi decent, fast charging on AC adapter, light-weight, sharp image viewing/resolution<br /><br />WEAKNESSES: no camera, needs touch to be calibrated, no Google Play support, speed not very fast, typing issues (use fingernails or a stylus), no video out or hdmi out, included file manager is unintuitive, no Nook/Kindle compatibility<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />TIPS:<br /><br />It\\'s not extremely fast, but it gets the job done. Make sure you calibrate the touch settings first. You can do this by: -Pressing the HOME button (the one that looks like a house). -Go to SETTINGS. -Tap on TOUCH PANEL CALIBRATION. -Follow the instructions.  If you do this, it\\'ll make your life much easier with this device.<br /><br />I don\\'t really like the included software suite (OfficeSuite). You can view Microsoft Office files, but you can\\'t edit them unless you purchase the activation (~$15). Download Kingsoft Office instead. It\\'s free, and you can actually edit and create new documents and such on it. Make sure you SAVE your work, kay guys?<br /><br />The included file explorer (EXPLORER) is not that great. I recommend downloading FILE EXPERT from the installed APPOKE MARKET. To use the APPOKE Android market, you\\'ll need to register.<br />***This tablet is not compatible with the Google Play Android market.***  You cannot download the market app nor download apps from the Google Play website. I personally called Google Play Customer Support, and they specifically told me that the EMATIC EBW404 is +NOT+ supported by Google Play. My wish is that they add support soon. The APPOKE market isn\\'t as comprehensive as the Google Play market. If you want more apps than APPOKE has available, might I suggest downloading the GETJAR app market? Most are free, and a lot of the same apps are in the Google Play market.<br /><br />I had some trouble watching YOUTUBE on the mobile website and the desktop version as well. I recommend downloading TUBEMATE from GETJAR. You don\\'t necessarily have to +download+ videos with TUBEMATE; it lets you watch videos.<br /><br />As far as the eReader is concerned: ***you won\\'t be able to read Nook or Kindle ebooks on this.***  It has KOBO, its own ebook store. Some are free, some aren\\'t. Try to find another third-party app that sells epub or pdf formats, as the built-in book reader will recognize pdf. NOTE: when you first try to directly open an epub ebook, you\\'ll get a message that says \\\\\\\\\"no handler\\\\\\\\\" or something that says that there\\'s no installed app to open it. Here\\'s how to work around that: -If you downloaded the FILE EXPERT app from APPOKE, tap on FILE EXPERT from the menu (after pressing the HOME button, the one shaped like a house). -Tap on MY FILES. -Go to SD CARD (this is where you find files you uploaded from your computer via USB to your tablet, regardless of whether you have a MICRO SD card physically installed). -Scroll down with your finger until you find the desired file (in this case, I used the included ebook <Alice in Wonderland.epub>). -DON\\'T TAP, but HOLD DOWN your finger or stylus on the file for 2-3 seconds. A menu \\\\\\\\\"FILE OPERATIONS\\\\\\\\\" will appear. Easiest to see all of it in PORTRAIT view (long and skinny view). - Tap on MORE... Another menu, OPERATION, will appear. -Tap on OPEN WITH. Another menu appears. -Tap on MORE... -Yet another menu appears. Different apps and options will appear on the menu. -Tapon EBOOKREADER. -Enjoy the book.<br /><br />***Be sure you charge the tablet when you open it from the box.***  The battery initially doesn\\'t have a whole lot of charge. It charges fastest when you use the included AC adapter.<br /><br />Sometimes, like any other computer or electronic device, it freezes. Turn the tablet over.  About an inch diagonal from the mini USB port is a small hole. That\\'s the reset button. It\\'s pretty small, so you\\'ll need something like a sewing needle or a really skinny paper clip or safety pin. Don\\'t press really hard. If the object won\\'t fit, don\\'t force  it. Find something else that\\'ll fit in the hole. Press for 2-3 seconds. You may have to reboot the tablet.<br /><br />Typing can be an issue. It takes a bit getting used to. Typing is easiest in LANDSCAPE view (longways/horizontal).<br /><br />If the tablet seems slow, use the included ADVANCED TASK MANAGER. Memory is limited, so be judicious with the apps you simultaneously have open.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Here are the apps that I got preinstalled on the device:<br />-ADVANCED TASK MANAGER<br />-ALARM CLOCK<br />-APPOKE MARKET<br />-AUDIO PLAYER<br />-BOX.NET<br />-BROWSER<br />-CALCULATOR<br />-DAILY PAPER<br />-EASY INSTALLER<br />-EASY UNINSTALLER<br />-EMAIL<br />-EXPLORER<br />-KOBO<br />-OFFICESUITE<br />-PHOTOS<br />-SETTINGS<br />-SOUND RECORDER<br />-VIDEO<br />Sorry, no Google Play Android app market.',\n",

              " \"Kind of ambivalent about this one. Belkin makes good stuff, and have been happy with other items in their line. There's really nothing to this, and part of the problem is the design of the iPod. Was hoping for a design that would shield the entire thing,including the glass touch screen,  but they aren't out there.  This is like a picture frame without anything to shield the art from the elements. Wanted to do this without getting a bulky water-resist product, and keep dirt out  of ports, etc. . This snaps on quickly, is not slippery, and does afford some degree of protection, mainly against scratches on the back. It's expensive for what one gets, though, and it's usefulness is yet to be determined. More later, if any opinion changes.\",\n",

First of all, the cable itself seems to be of high quality.  This is the second iPod dock-connection-to-3.5mm cable I purchased (I'm able to actually disconnect the jack from the headphones itself) and this one seemed to be of higher quality.  The problem with the first cable I bought was that after a couple of months the cable wire bent then broke at the base of the iPod connector.  This one definitely seems sturdier.  Unfortunately, the iPod connection doesn't stay firmly in the dock when I'm moving around.  Obviously, it probably wasn't designed for that - they probably didn't envision someone would be using the cable as a replacment headphone cable.  But still...that's why I say this cable is only ok.  If your plan is to use it with a car or home stereo, however, I would definitely recommend.\",\n",

It gives an almost neon tube effect at the edges when it\\'s backlit, a look I love. Fingerprints aren\\'t particularly visible and dirt doesn\\'t seem to stick to it much. I also like that it\\'s transparent, so I can slip black-and-white artwork between it and the iPad\\'s back for an even more distinctive look. Finally, it has a pleasant overall feel, making the iPad easier to hold and prop up than a naked iPad.<br /><br />Cons: Quality is mediocre. There are rough mold joins around the whole perimeter and each cutout that are mildly irritating to the fingers. It\\'s not quite tight enough, so it often slips off a bit, especially next to the home button. The covers for the volume control and power switches are poorly distinguished by texture, making it hard to find them without looking.<br /><br />I also own a plain, mostly clear but slightly taupey-grayish Scosche \\\\\\\\\"glosSEE\\\\\\\\\" skin [...]. It is fantastic quality in all the ways this one is not -- smooth edges, perfect fit, perfect differentiation on the switches. It\\'s also very slightly harder and slicker, but just as easy to hold. However, I think it\\'s ugly -- it\\'s definitely not neutral or crystal-clear, and it\\'s aged quickly in the year I\\'ve had it, looking dingy and smeary. I don\\'t really like using it in a professional setting. If the Scosche was available in bright red, I\\'d probably get one anyway, but it isn\\'t.',\n",

This case is perfect for my 5th gen Nano--it fits securely, but I know I could get it off if I needed to. (Have you ever felt that pang of fear when you snap on a case and then wonder if you'll ever be able to get it off without a chisel? Not to worry here.)    I did end up using the stick on screen protector, and now that's it on, I don't think I'll be trying to get it off. But you wouldn't have to use it if you are nervous about sticking it on the screen--the case has a screen protector already. The whole thing's plastic. (Nothing cut out around the screen area.)    Another thing that upped my approval was that I could put earbuds with thick push ins in. That might be a tad hard to follow, but if you use a different set of earbuds than the one that came with the iPod, they tend to have like a squarish plastic joint that attaches the wire to the plug. I did not have any trouble with these plugging in to the case. (I've had experiences where I try to use them and the whole case unsnaps and falls off.)The little bag to store the Nano in was a nice little bonus too. I haven't used it much, but it's nice if you want to throw it in a backpack and not worry about the earbuds getting all tangled.    Affordable and functional.\",\n",

Claims of up to 27% longer battery life are true and perhaps understated!  The website recommends that the initial charge be 12 hours even thought the charge meter indicates fully charged in a few hours.  Doing a 12 hour initial charge prolongs future battery life. After the initial overnight charge, subsequent charges are as quick or quicker than the original iPod battery - that being a few hours.      As a test to see how long the battery would last I set the music on repeat and normal volume level and let it go until full discharged.  It's been 11 hours continuous and still going(!!) Much longer run time than the 7 hours that I was hoping for and the 5 or so hours typical on a regular new iPod battery. This battery has far surpassed my expectations even though I expect that with intermittent use it will need more frequent charges. Nonetheless if I ever need a special battery for anything I will check out [...] products first! And the battery comes with a one year warranty, registration on their web site required.      Battery cost me $20 delivered and while there were cheaper ones on the web, I thought the few dollars more spent to get the extra battery life would be worth it, and indeed that has proven so. The provided tools worked fine too although an extra pair of hands to get the case open may help. Easy to install but pay attention to what you are doing.
